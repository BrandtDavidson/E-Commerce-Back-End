# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This application is an exercise in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) by implementing api routes for an E-Commerce backend. 
Utilization of Express in combination with Node.js and MySQL allows for a user/retail owner to request and receive database information.

These API Routes perform RESTful CRUD Operations. This application also follows the CRUD model by being able to perform create, read, update, and delete operations connected with Sequelize models. 

## Criteria and Technologies Used
- Packages include Express.js, Sequelize (query methods), Node.js
- MySQL Database use
- Used Insomnia to test api environments 
- For Products, Tags, and Category a user can: 
    - GET (method) All to retrieve all seeded/added objects under the data model
    - GET (method) by associated id
    - PUT (method) to update by id
    - DEL (method) to delete by id 
    - POST (method) to create a new object (item) in the database
